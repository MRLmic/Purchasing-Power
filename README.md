# Searchable Front-End for Supporting Small Businesses

## Overview

This project aims to provide a **searchable front-end** based on CSV data collected from the [Cancel This Clothing Company Resources](https://cancelthisclothingcompany.com/resources/). The goal is to empower consumers with information that enables them to make informed decisions about which businesses to support, avoid contributing to investment firms approaching a monopolistic hold, and promote small businesses and healthy competition.

## Purpose

My intention for the project is to provide an easy-to-use interface where users can search through various businesses listed in the CSV files. By offering data about these businesses, it helps consumers:
- **Support small businesses** over large corporations.
- **Avoid monopolistic companies** and make choices that promote competition.
- **Make informed purchasing decisions** by evaluating the social and environmental impact of different brands.
